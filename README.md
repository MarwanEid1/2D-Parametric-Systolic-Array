Digital Design of a 2D Parametric n Ã— n Systolic Array For Matrix Multiplication using SystemVerilog. The repository includes two self-checking testbenches (N = 4 and N = 8) that generate random matrices and inject them into the array are included. Additionally, a do file is provided for execution using QuestaSim.
